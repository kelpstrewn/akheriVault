## Introduction
Conservation architects, architectural historians and urban historians are all in in agreement about the recording of the physical fabric of historic buildings. There is an Icomos document devoted to this issue. This is [Principles for the recording of monuments , groups of buildings and sites](/img/https://www.icomos.org/charters/archives-e.pdf) (Icomos 1996 ). This document states that it is important to provide "a permanent record of all monuments, groups of buildings and sites that are to be destroyed or altered in any way, or where at risk from natural events or human activities".
 
An advisory document for building recording in New Zealand is "Investigation and Recording of Buildings and Standing Structures". It is still available from Heritage New Zealand [here](/img/http://www.heritage.org.nz/~/-/media/bd20738fc99e4f69bec8cec6395b251a.ashx). The document is dated 2006 and has been assigned an isbn number, 978-0-908577-91-0 (online). Authorship is not stated, but an archaeologist employed by the trust, Martin Jones, is thought to be largely responsible.

The document describes methods of recording and appropriate levels or intensity of recording from level one to level four.The methods suggested are traditional and paper based. Film photography and the use of 4H pencil on permatrace for the preparation of manual drawings are privileged. This national guidance advisory does not advise with regard to the fate of the data gathered, and who the data should be accessed by.

## Criticism
There has been criticism from people working in New Zealand as conservation architects and building recorders of "Investigation and Recording of Buildings and Standing Structures". This criticism is centred around a lack of clarity about the levels stated, and what they mean, as the levels are defined by the addition of words such as extensive and comprehensive as the level of significance rises. These words are not further defined within the document. The lack of acknowledgement of the pervasiveness of digital methods in building recording now, and in architectural practice here, and the lack of clear guidance around the maintenance of archives, and of access of the interested public to building records are also regarded as significant detriments to the value of this document.


## Structure from motion
Structure from motion (sfm) is a technique that is a development of photogrammery. Multiple photographs from different viewpoints are taken. These are taken into a digital environment and software is used to automatically calculate the viewpoint from which each photo was taken. The software then matches points from photo to photo, and use this information to calculate the 3d coordinates of each point. The software is then able to make a 3d mesh based on the point cloud and to apply a texture to the mesh.

The resulting model is scale indeterminate. It is then imported into 3d mesh manipulation software such as cloudcomparee or even sketchup. Here, the model can be scaled, according to reference (or "control") measurements made on site. 

 The heart of this system is software based. Because of the high computing demands of the software there are  'cloud' based software solutions. Over the last five years I have recorded a number of buildings and monuments using cloud based solutions such as; Autodesk 123d Catch, (discontinued several years ago) Autodesk Recap, (discontinued recently) and local pc based solutions such as Colmap, 3df Zephyr and Agisoft Photoscan. 

 I have experimented with different camera types, point and shoot cameras, dslr cameras, and phone cameras. Results were usable in most cases. Accuracy is largely dependent on the quality and number of images used. The use of a large sensor dslr camera off a tripod and in ideal overcast light conditions gives the best results.  A reasonably high spec computer with cuda cores speeds the process greatly.

Poor results are obtained when there are difficulties getting multiple unobscured shots of the subject building. This is the case when there are other buildings or objects in the foreground, or when obscuring vegetation is present. Buildings that are built of very uniform and slightly reflective material also return poor results as the software has difficulty in fixing points between photographs.

## Cyark

The state of the art now, with regard to public presentation of building records is to be found in websites produced by organisations such as Cyark.  CyArk was founded in 2003 in response to the Taliban's destruction of the 1600-year-old Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.  Cyark's goal is to ensure that heritage sites are available to future generations, while making them  accessible to the public online now.  New technologies are being used to create a free, 3D online library of the world's cultural heritage sites. Particular attention is paid to sites that are likely to be  lost to natural disasters, destroyed by human activity or and lack of activity (maintenance).

## Conclusions
Institutions around the world are now moving to a web based presentation of their heritage. Such sites often allow for user manipulation of heritage 3d models, textured, or dense coloured point clouds, together with hotspots and links to historic images and commentary, both textual and audio based.
